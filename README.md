# README

These are some interesting snippets for `R` in `yasnippet` format that I 
either found or made myself. They are easily adaptable to R Studio snippets,
the internal syntax is as far as I can tell the same, the header is the 
only thing that changes.

I'm always on the hunt for more, too. I put them up here mostly to make it 
easier to move them from point A to point B. If you have any good ones or 
suggestions, feel free to let me know.
